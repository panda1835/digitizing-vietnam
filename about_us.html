            <h2>What's Digitizing Vietnam?</h2>
            <p>Digitizing Vietnam, a joint project between Columbia University and Fulbright University Vietnam with support from the Luce Foundation, aims to create a state-of-the-art digital platform for Vietnamese Studies. This initiative focuses on building the Digital Hub, a virtual library providing access to digitized historical documents, modern archives in Vietnam, and advanced digital tools. By connecting Vietnam Studies and Computer Science at FUV, the project seeks to enhance historical preservation in Vietnam and revolutionize global Vietnamese Studies through close collaboration and innovation.</p>
